Important ILRI-specific notes for DSpace development using git

1. Be careful to not commit sensitive information to the repository.  Files with passwords, for example, should be set to "unchanged" in git:

	git update-index --assume-unchanged dspace/config/dspace.cfg

This is different than an ignore, as we want DSpace to track that the file exists, just not our changes!
